# Active Development Context

## Current State
**Phase 2 Complete** - The entire codebase has been refactored to be compatible with shared hosting environments. The application is now fully reliant on the `PathResolver` and the universal bootstrap system. All major file operations and the setup wizard are confirmed to be working with simulated restrictions.

## Just Completed (Phase 2)
1.  **Full Codebase Refactoring**: Updated all controllers and models (`FileModel`, `FolderModel`, `UserModel`, `UploadModel`, `AdminModel`, `AuthController`, etc.) to use `PathResolver` for all file system interactions.
2.  **Setup Wizard Repaired**: Fixed the admin user detection logic in `AuthController` to work correctly under `open_basedir` restrictions.
3.  **Unified Configuration**: Consolidated `config.php` and `config.shared-hosting.php` into a single, universal `config/config.php` that dynamically adapts to the environment.
4.  **Bootstrap Enhancement**: Moved all session, login, and environment setup logic into `src/SharedHosting/bootstrap.php` to create a single, reliable entry point for initialization.
5.  **Automated Verification**: Successfully ran `test-pathresolver.php` and `test-shared-config.php` to validate the new architecture.

## Key Achievements
- ✅ **100% Path Abstraction**: All hardcoded file paths have been eliminated from the application logic.
- ✅ **Simplified Configuration**: A single `config.php` now governs all installation types.
- ✅ **Centralized Bootstrap**: All environment setup is handled in one place, improving maintainability.
- ✅ **Setup Wizard Fixed**: The setup process is now reliable on shared hosting.
- ✅ **Automated Tests Passed**: Core components are verified to be working correctly.

## Technical Details

### PathResolver Strategies
1. Environment variable (FILERISE_ROOT)
2. Known file detection (composer.json, etc.)
3. Current location traversal
4. Document root analysis
5. Working directory fallback

### Data Directory Handling
- Tries traditional locations first (/var/www/*)
- Falls back to project root
- Creates directories if needed
- Adds .htaccess and index.html for security
- Uses obfuscated names on shared hosting

### Auto-Detection Logic
Shared hosting mode activates when:
- open_basedir is set
- Can't write to /var/www/
- Path contains /home/, /public_html, /httpdocs
- FILERISE_SHARED_HOSTING env var is true

## Next Phase (Phase 3: Manual Testing & Deployment)

### Priority Tasks
1.  **Manual End-to-End Testing**: Perform comprehensive manual testing of all application features in a real or simulated shared hosting environment.
2.  **WebDAV Compatibility Check**: Investigate and address any remaining issues with WebDAV functionality.
3.  **Deployment to Staging**: Deploy the application to a live shared hosting provider (e.g., Netcup, 1&1) for real-world validation.
4.  **Documentation Update**: Update user-facing documentation (installation guide, etc.) to reflect the new simplified setup process.

## Outstanding Questions
1.  How should we handle file permissions for user-uploaded files on different shared hosts?
2.  Should a compatibility report/check be added to the admin UI to help users diagnose their environment?
3.  What is the best strategy for migrating existing standard installations to this new universal structure?

## Next Session Goals
1.  Perform a full manual test of the application.
2.  Deploy the application to a staging shared hosting account.
3.  Document any bugs or issues found during manual testing.

## Environment Status
- Local dev: Working perfectly
- Test environment: Fully configured
- Shared hosting test: Ready but not deployed
- Production testing: Not started

## Code Quality Notes
- All new code follows PSR-12
- Extensive inline documentation
- Error suppression used judiciously (@)
- No external dependencies added

## Next Session Goals
1. Implement CompatibleFileManager
2. Update at least 5 critical files
3. Fix setup wizard detection
4. Deploy to one shared hosting for testing
