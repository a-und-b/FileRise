# FileRise Shared Hosting Fork - Active Context

## Current Focus
Testing environment for shared hosting simulation has been created. Ready to begin codebase analysis.

## Recent Activities
1. **Project Initialization** (Completed)
   - Created memory bank structure
   - Documented project requirements
   - Established technical context
   - Defined system patterns

2. **Testing Environment Setup** (Completed)
   - Created PHP configuration files for strict and moderate restrictions
   - Built environment checker script (`check-environment.php`)
   - Built restriction tester script (`test-restrictions.php`)
   - Created FileRise compatibility checker (`test-filerise-compatibility.php`)
   - Made launcher script (`test-shared-hosting.sh`) with multiple scenarios
   - Documented testing procedures in `testing/README.md`

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Codebase Analysis (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Analyze `config/config.php` for hardcoded paths
- [ ] Review all PHP files for `dirname(__DIR__)` usage
- [ ] Identify open_basedir incompatible operations
- [ ] Map out current directory assumptions
- [ ] Document all external file access points

### 2. Path Detection Implementation (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Create `src/SharedHosting/PathResolver.php`
- [ ] Implement environment detection strategies
- [ ] Build configuration cascade system
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Create diagnostic tools

### 3. Setup Wizard Fix (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Locate setup wizard logic
- [ ] Fix admin user detection
- [ ] Add permission checking
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Test on shared hosting

## Testing Environment Details

### Available Testing Commands
```bash
# Moderate restrictions (development)
./testing/test-shared-hosting.sh

# Strict restrictions (production simulation)
./testing/test-shared-hosting.sh --strict

# Test different hosting scenarios
./testing/test-shared-hosting.sh --scenario=cpanel
./testing/test-shared-hosting.sh --scenario=plesk
./testing/test-shared-hosting.sh --scenario=subfolder
```

### Test Scripts Created
1. **check-environment.php** - Shows PHP configuration and restrictions
2. **test-restrictions.php** - Tests specific operations that might fail
3. **test-filerise-compatibility.php** - Checks FileRise requirements
4. **test-shared-hosting.sh** - Launcher with various options

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Approach**: Maintain backward compatibility while adding shared hosting support
2. **Architecture**: Use detection strategies with fallbacks rather than configuration
3. **Testing**: Created comprehensive local testing environment before implementation
4. **Development**: Will use moderate restrictions for development, strict for validation

## Open Questions
1. **WebDAV Support**: How to handle when .htaccess rewriting isn't available?
2. **Large Files**: Best approach for chunked uploads within PHP limits?
3. **Directory Structure**: Should we recommend specific layouts for shared hosting?

## Active Considerations

### Security on Shared Hosting
- Cannot rely on directory-based security (.htaccess)
- Need programmatic access control
- Consider using randomized paths for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting at application level

### Performance Optimization
- Shared hosting has limited resources
- Need efficient caching strategies
- Minimize file system operations
- Consider lazy loading for large directories

### User Experience
- Clear error messages for hosting limitations
- Guided setup process
- Automatic feature detection
- Helpful diagnostics for troubleshooting

## Development Environment
- **IDE**: Cursor with AI assistance
- **Testing**: Local PHP with shared hosting simulation ready
- **Version Control**: Git (forked from original FileRise)
- **Documentation**: Memory bank system

## Current Blockers
None - testing environment is ready, can proceed with codebase analysis.

## Next Session Plan
1. Run initial compatibility test on current FileRise code
2. Search for all hardcoded paths using grep
3. Analyze config.php structure
4. Map out file operation patterns
5. Document findings and plan refactoring

## Testing Strategy
1. **Local Testing** âœ… (Environment ready)
   - Simulate open_basedir restrictions
   - Test with minimal PHP extensions
   - Verify all fallback mechanisms

2. **Shared Hosting Testing** (Pending)
   - Netcup (German provider)
   - 1&1 IONOS
   - One US provider (TBD)

3. **Backward Compatibility** (Pending)
   - Ensure existing installations work
   - Test migration paths
   - Verify no breaking changes

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing installations
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive backward compatibility testing
  
- **Risk**: Poor performance on shared hosting
  - **Mitigation**: Optimization and caching strategies
  
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple security layers, code review
