## Known Issues (Original FileRise)

### 1. Setup Wizard
- **Issue**: Doesn't correctly detect if admin user exists
- **Impact**: Users get stuck in setup loop
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: Not investigated

### 2. Path Restrictions
- **Issue**: Hardcoded paths break on shared hosting
- **Impact**: Installation fails with permission errors
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: Documented, solution planned

### 3. Directory Structure
- **Issue**: Assumes specific folder hierarchy
- **Impact**: Cannot adapt to hosting requirements
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: Solution designed

### 4. open_basedir
- **Issue**: Attempts to access parent directories
- **Impact**: PHP errors on shared hosting
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: Approach defined

## Development Velocity
- **Start Date**: January 2025
- **Current Phase**: Testing environment complete, ready for implementation
- **Next Review**: After codebase analysis

## Testing Environment Capabilities
‚úÖ **Simulation Features**
- open_basedir restrictions
- Limited PHP functions
- Memory and execution limits
- Different directory structures (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)
- Strict and moderate restriction modes

‚úÖ **Test Scripts**
- Environment configuration display
- Restriction testing
- FileRise compatibility checking
- Multiple hosting scenario support

## Success Metrics Tracking
- [ ] Installation success rate: Target 95%
- [ ] Setup completion time: Target < 5 minutes
- [ ] Feature compatibility: Target 100% core features
- [ ] Performance impact: Target < 10% slower

## Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Status |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Breaking existing installs | Low | High | Testing env ready |
| WebDAV incompatibility | Medium | Medium | Investigating |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Monitoring tools ready |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | In design |

## Next Actions
1. Run compatibility test on current FileRise
2. Analyze codebase for hardcoded paths
3. Begin implementing path detection system
