# FileRise Shared Hosting Progress

## Current Status
**Phase 2 Implementation Complete** - The codebase is now fully refactored for shared hosting compatibility. All core logic uses dynamic path resolution, and the configuration has been unified.

## Completed Work

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (DONE)
- **PathResolver Class** (src/SharedHosting/PathResolver.php)
  - Dynamic path detection with 5 strategies
  - Works within open_basedir restrictions
  - Caching for performance
  - Supports standard and shared hosting paths
  
- **Bootstrap System** (src/SharedHosting/bootstrap.php)
  - Initializes shared hosting environment
  - Defines all constants dynamically
  - Sets up autoloading
  - Creates security files automatically
  - Runtime fixes for common restrictions
  
- **Compatible Config** (config/config.shared-hosting.php)
  - Auto-detects shared hosting environment
  - Falls back to standard mode when possible
  - Fully backward compatible
  - Includes safe include helpers
  
- **Security Hardening**
  - .htaccess files in all data directories
  - index.html fallbacks
  - Denies direct access to sensitive files
  - Works with Apache 2.2 and 2.4

### âœ… Phase 2: Codebase Refactoring & Unification (DONE)
- **Full Refactoring**: All models and controllers now use `PathResolver`.
- **Setup Wizard Fixed**: Admin detection now works reliably on shared hosting.
- **Unified `config.php`**: Single, smart config file for all environments.
- **Enhanced Bootstrap**: Handles all session, login, and environment logic.
- **Automated Verification**: Passed all core tests for `PathResolver` and the new config.

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Manual Testing & Deployment (Next)
- [ ] Perform full end-to-end manual testing.
- [ ] Test on a live shared hosting provider (Netcup, 1&1, etc.).
- [ ] Validate WebDAV functionality.
- [ ] Create/update user documentation for installation.
- [ ] Investigate migration path for existing users.

## Testing Status

### Local Testing âœ…
- **PathResolver**: All scenarios working correctly.
- **Configuration**: Universal `config.php` loads and functions as expected.
- **Automated Scripts**: `test-pathresolver.php` and `test-shared-config.php` pass.

### Shared Hosting Testing ðŸ”„
- [ ] Netcup (German provider)
- [ ] 1&1 IONOS
- [ ] HostGator or similar US provider
- [ ] cPanel environment
- [ ] Plesk environment

## Known Issues
1.  **WebDAV**: Functionality confirmed to need review after refactoring.
2.  **Permissions**: File permissions for user-uploaded content need a robust, cross-platform strategy.

## Metrics
- **Files Modified**: ~15 (All major models, controllers, and configuration files).
- **Files Deleted**: 1 (`config/config.php` legacy).
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500 lines refactored.
- **Test Coverage**: Core components verified via automated scripts.
- **Commits**: 4 (phase 1, phase 2 refactoring, config unification, test fixes).

## Next Immediate Steps
1.  Begin comprehensive manual testing of all user-facing features.
2.  Deploy the application to a live shared hosting environment for staging.
3.  Create a bug list for any issues found during manual testing.

## Architecture Decisions
- âœ… **Dynamic detection over configuration**: Confirmed as the correct approach.
- âœ… **Single `config.php`**: Simplifies installation and maintenance.
- âœ… **Self-contained bootstrap**: Centralizes environment setup for reliability.
- âœ… **Security-first approach**: Maintained throughout refactoring.
